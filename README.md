# Lab Session
> CS4243: Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, AY 2023/24

## Introduction
Welcome to the lab session of [CS4243](https://nusmods.com/courses/CS4243/computer-vision-and-pattern-recognition) :wave:!

This course is for undergraduates who are interested in computer vision and its applications. It covers:
1. The basic skills needed in handling images and videos.
2. The basic theories needed to understand geometrical computer vision.
3. Pattern recognition.

- Topics covered in image handling include: contrast stretch, histogram equalization, noise removal, and color space.
- Topics covered in geometrical vision include: affine transform, vanishing points, camera projection models, homography, camera calibration, rotation representations including quaternions, epipolar geometry, binocular stereo, structure from motion.
- Topics covered for pattern recognition include principal component analysis.
